=========
Control yourself on facebook: see how many times you enter and how much time do you spend on it.

![example](images/example.jpg)

To do
-----
* Redesign popup
* Show today's usage and daily average instead of accumulated usage time
* Real time counter instead of update after last facebook tab is closed
* Pause timer when no facebook tab is focused
* Migrate to chrome.storage for sync purposes
